basics of ai and ml
what is diff btw ai and ml
where we usee them

linear data structures implementation
non linear DS implementation and aloso traversal of that DS
applications of Data structure
what is meant by tree and graph and representaion of the graph,tree

database
normalization
why we need normalization lik 1nf,2nf,3nf,bcnf
acid properties
joins

oops concepts

bubble sort
selection sort
inseertion sort
merge sort
quick sort
code and time complexity
binary search

square root of a number
count the number of occurrences of each charcter in a given string
sort 0s,1s,2s
max sum subarray(kadanes algo)
element that occur once in the array all other are twice
loop and middle in the linked list
reverse the linked list
implement stack using array/queue using array
next greater element




intro
what are the types ogf join
diff bw 2nf and 3nf
acid properties
2 sql quiers subquries
pointers y there are not present in java or python
reverse the double linked list
oops concepts
project in detail
wht is ml
supervised and unsupervised
how do u clean data and what is the procedure
explain navie bayes,random forest,decision trees,bagging,confusion matrix,underfitting and overfitting,varience and bias
what if u do if there are null values in the age col
classfication and example
key features of python
diff bt list and tuple
y python is interpeted language
expection handling
packages and modules
truncate query
what are apis adn methods like post get put delete
diff btw tuptle and set
bitwise operators and tell about bitwise operators
double linked list and deleteing node in double linkindin list
cloud computing
osi model in cn
interpreter and compilier
MR and HR qns
what makes me different from other people in hiring
why would u like to join TCS
